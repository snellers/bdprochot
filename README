## Setup

This pokes a machine specific register to disable the BD PROCHOT. Only suitable if your CPU is being forced to underclock due to a dodgy temperature reading. Using it otherwise may cause a CPU to overheat.

To make this run on system startup add this to /etc/systemd/system/bdprochot.service and put bdprochot.sh in /etc
